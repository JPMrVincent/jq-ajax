# Separate ajax methods from jquery

Based on jquery.1.11.1min.js for separation, the volume is only 22kb.

# Requirement
1. for normal Ajax request requirements
2. Some apis cross domains and use JSONP for requests
3. Third party APIs, clearly requiring the use of JSONP

# JSONP Principle

By changing all remote post or get requests to get requests, the so-called non cross domain request method is achieved. In fact, there is a layer of proxy mechanism in the intermediate code. Let's take a closer look at the code.

Add a callBack method for callback, or leave it blank.

# Version

This is the 2018 version and no changes have been made so far. Change the $ in jquery to J$ to facilitate the complete introduction of jquery components into the project without occupying jquery $. This version will no longer be updated. The one who with requirements can disassemble other versions themselves, which usually takes 2-3 hours to complete.

# Example
window.J$.ajax({

  method: '',
  
  url: '',
  
  async:  false,
  
  headers: {},
  
  data: {},
  
  dataType: '',
  
  contentType: '',
  
  crossDomain: false,
  
  timeout: '',
  
  success: (res) => {},
  
  error: (err) => {}
  
}),
